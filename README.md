### Main functions in the TravelLanka
#### Hotel & Restaurent Management
##### 
• The administrator of the web application should be able to add the information of Hotels, 
restaurants, cabanas and villas located in different regions of the island. <br>
• This is also included with the information on complementary meals and traditional cuisine 
and other value additions offered by those entities for their visitors.

#### Tour Package Management
####
• The administrator of the web application should be able to add the information on Tour 
and Site seeing packages that have been designed according to the iconic locations 
dispersed all around the country. <br>
• These information on packages are managed and updated with the activities that could 
be experienced by the travelers who visit those areas (Ex. snorkeling, diving, cycling, 
whale watching, experiencing the village life style), the places of ancient archeological 
values and the unique locations that have been identified as exclusive attractions of 
travelers and the places where they could rent out bikes and motor vehicles.
